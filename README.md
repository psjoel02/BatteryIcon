# BatteryIcon
Windows battery icon alternative.

Microsoft's default battery indicator in the taskbar is oftentimes buggy when using valinet's ExplorerPatcher. This indicator aims to replicate the 
functionality of the default battery indicator that comes default with Windows 10 (and now removed and unable to switch profiles in W11)
while adding in brightness controls and other useful features from other battery software like tarcode-apps Battery Mode.
